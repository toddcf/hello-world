# hello-world
My name is Todd.  I'm just starting out in coding.  Back in 2008, I taught myself basic HTML from a book and designed my own rudimentary website.  Now I am enrolled in a coding boot camp that runs from June to December 2016, after which I will officially transition into a career in coding.
My plan is to learn everything in the boot camp, but pay close attention to the areas I connect with the most in order to decide specifically which type of jobs I want to apply for.
Aside from coding, I'm a screenwriter and novelist.  (I've also formatted my own Kindle books, and I think becoming a fullstack coder will improve that skill for me, as well.)  I love hiking and cycling, and I have four years of Krav Maga training.
Recently, a wind storm blew a large tree onto my 1997 Chevy Lumina, so I bit the bullet and bought a 2016 Honda Civic, which I love.  (It's a relief not to be sinking major money into repairing an old car each year.)
I look forward to my adventures in coding!
